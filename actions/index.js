/*
To manage your AsyncStorage database, you'll want to create four different helper methods.

getDecks: return all of the decks along with their titles, questions, and answers. 
getDeck: take in a single id argument and return the deck associated with that id. 
saveDeckTitle: take in a single title argument and add it to the decks. 
addCardToDeck: take in two arguments, title and card, and will add the card to the list of questions for the deck with the associated title.
